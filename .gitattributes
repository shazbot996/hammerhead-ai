# Set the default behavior for all text files.
# Git will normalize line endings to LF in the repository and convert them
# to the OS-native line endings on checkout (CRLF on Windows, LF on Linux).
* text=auto

# Explicitly force LF line endings for files that must be run on Linux.
# This overrides the 'auto' setting and prevents CRLF conversion on Windows.
*.sh    eol=lf
*.py    eol=lf

# Declare files that should be treated as binary and not have their line endings changed.
